Phase 1 — Acquire Sepolia ETH
Timestamp: Thursday December 4th 2025 - 16:49 Eastern Time


Summary of Actions

• Attempted to obtain Sepolia ETH using the Infura faucet.
• Infura required Linea Proof of Humanity verification, which did not register correctly even after successful verification on the Linea page.
• Attempted the Alchemy faucet, but it required the wallet to hold mainnet ETH.
• As both official faucets introduced blockers, pivoted to using the Sepolia PoW Faucet (pk910.de).
• Successfully mined and claimed 0.0514 SepoliaETH and 0.0691, in two separate transactions, which is more than sufficient for bridging to zkSync and deploying the SimpleStorage contract.


Faucet Used

Sepolia PoW Faucet
https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

This faucet uses a lightweight Proof-of-Work mechanism to ensure bot resistance and does not require mainnet ETH, logins, or identity verification.
